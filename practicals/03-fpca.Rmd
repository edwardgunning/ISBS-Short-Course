# Short Data Description

We have taken a sample of functional observations from the GaitRec dataset (Horsak et al., 2020). These functional data represent the vertical ground reaction force measured during walking using force plates for a group of **Healthy controls**. They are defined on the normalised time domain $[0. 100]$ where $0$ represents the start of the stance phase when the foot touches the force plate and $100$ represents the end. The force is normalised to body weight.

We also have a scalar variable, the **maximum anterior-posterior** force produced during the same trial.

# Load Data

You should download for this practical the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/edwardgunning/ISBS-Short-Course/blob/main/practicals/fpca-data.rds) and place it in your working directory. Then we load it and unpack the objects as follows.

```{r}
fpca_data <- readRDS(file = "fpca-data.rds")
grf_fd <- fpca_data$grf_fd # grf functional data object
max_ap <- fpca_data$max_ap # scalar max ap variable
t_grid <- 0:100 # grid of points we'll use to evaluate
```

# Data Exploration

First we will simply plot the functions, which are stored in the `grf_fd` object, using the `plot.fd()` function.

```{r explor-plot, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.75}
plot.fd(x = grf_fd, xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
title(main = "Vertical GRF")
```

Now, we can look at the sample mean function and the sample covariance function.

## Mean

```{r}
mean_grf_fd <- mean.fd(x = grf_fd)
plot(mean_grf_fd, xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
title(main = "Sample Mean Vertical GRF")
```

## Covariance Function

```{r}
cov_grf_bifd <- var.fd(fdobj1 = grf_fd)
cov_grf_eval <- eval.bifd(sevalarg = t_grid, tevalarg = t_grid, bifd = cov_grf_bifd)
filled.contour(x = 0:100, y = 0:100, z = cov_grf_eval, xlab = "s", ylab = "t")
```

By looking at the diagonal from left to right which represents the pointwise variance we see that the most variance is between $0$ and $20$ (dark red spots). We also see some negative dependence (very light yellow) between at $s=50$, $t=20$ and at $s=80$, $t=50$ (and vice-versa because the covariance function is symmetric). This indicates an inverse relationship between function values at these pairs of points. That is, for example, higher-than-average peaks at $t=20$ are associated with lower-than-average dip in the middle of the curve at $t=20$.
Now, lets look at a more intuitive way of understanding the variation in the vertical GRF curves using fpca.

# Applying FPCA

We apply FPCA to our data using the `pca.fd()` function, with the following arguments:

* `fdobj` this is the functional data object we apply FPCA to (in this case `grf_fd`)

* `nharm` this how many FPCs we want to extract, in our case we'll extract the first $6$ (which we show later explain approximately $95\%$ of the variance).

* ` harmfdPar` this is an `fdPar` object that can be used to represent the FPCs -- we can use any basis and a smoothing penalty to represent them. We leave this argument blank so to use the default which is the same basis that's being used to represent our data, with no smoothing penalty (note: in some situations, enforcing smoohtness in FPCs can be very beneficial).

```{r}
grf_pca.fd <- pca.fd(fdobj = grf_fd, nharm = 6)
```

# Unpacking the `pca.fd()` object

We can extract the following parts of the `pca.fd` object returned by `pca.fd()`:

* The **FPC functions** are returned as a `fd` object named harmonics.

```{r}
grf_fpc_funs_fd <- grf_pca.fd$harmonics
```

* The **FPC scores** are returned in an $N \times 6$ matrix.

```{r}
grf_fpc_scores <- grf_pca.fd$scores
```

* The **eigenvalues**, which represent the **amount of variance explained** by the FPCs, are contained in a vector called `values`.

```{r}
grf_eigenvalues <- grf_pca.fd$values
# actually shows all possible values, we just want first 6
grf_eigenvalues <- grf_eigenvalues[1:6]
```

* The **normalised eigenvalues** that represent the **proportion of variance explained** are contained in the vector called `varprop`.

```{r}
grf_varprop <- grf_pca.fd$varprop
```

# Describing the FPCA

First, let's make a table displaying the amount of variance explained by each FPC, as well as the cumulative amount of variance explained.

```{r}
info_df <- data.frame(`FPC Number` = 1:6,
           `Eigenvalue` = round(grf_eigenvalues, 2),
           `Proportion of Variance` = round(grf_varprop, 2),
           `Cumulative Proportion of Variance` = cumsum(round(grf_varprop, 2)))

kableExtra::kable(info_df) # fancy table markdown output
```
Now, we can plot the FPCs as perturbations of the mean function using `plot.pca.fd()`, passing the `pca.fd` object as our argument.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.asp=2/3}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot.pca.fd(x = grf_pca.fd)
```
We can see that the first FPC (FPC1), which represents almost $50%$ of variance, shows that high scorers ('+') have higher-than-average peaks at $t=20$ and $t=80$ with lower-than-average dip in the middle of the curve at $t=50$, reflecting the contrast we saw in the covariance function contour plot.

We can also relate these to actual curves in the dataset, by looking at the subjects with the highest and lowest FPC scores.

```{r, fig.asp=0.5, fig.width=12}
grf_fpc1_score <- grf_fpc_scores[,1]
max_ind <- which.max(grf_fpc1_score)
min_ind <- which.min(grf_fpc1_score)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot.pca.fd(x = grf_pca.fd, harm = 1)
plot(grf_fd[c(min_ind, max_ind)])
legend("bottom", 
       col = c(1,2), 
       lty = c(1, 2), 
       legend = c("Min FPC1 score", "Max FPC1 score"),
       "Lowest and Highest FPC1 Scorers")
```

We see that the curves on the right plot are the extrema of the curves typified by the '-' and '+' on the left plot.

# FPCs as basis functions

We can also interpret the FPCs as basis functions to approximate the individual functional observations through the representation
$$
x_i(t) \approx \bar{x}(t) + \sum_{r=1}^R \xi_{ir}\psi_{r}(t)
$$

where:

* $x_i$ is the $i$th curve

* $\bar{x}(t)$ is the sample mean function

* $\xi_{ir}$ is the $r$th FPC score for the $i$th curve

* $\psi_{r}(t)$ is the $r$th FPC function

Lets look at this approximation for the $1$st subject. We multiply the scores (basis coefficients) by the FPCs (basis functions). To do this we need to multiply the scores by the basis coefficients that represent the FPCs.

```{r}
subject_1_scores <- grf_fpc_scores[1, ]
new_coefs <- as.vector(subject_1_scores %*% t(grf_fpc_funs_fd$coefs))
scores_times_fpcs_fd <- fd(coef = new_coefs, basisobj = grf_fpc_funs_fd$basis)
approximation_subject_1_fd <- mean_grf_fd + scores_times_fpcs_fd
```


Now, let's look at the reconstruction:

```{r}
plot(approximation_subject_1_fd)
lines(grf_fd[1,], lty = 2)
legend("bottom", c("True", "FPC Approx"), lty = c(2, 1))
```

It's pretty close, but we'll need to use more than $6$ FPCs if we want to improve it!

# **Exercise:** Use the scores in downstream analysis

Use the FPC scores from the Vertical GRF to predict the scalar variable of Maximum Anterior Posterior Force (`max_ap`) using a linear regression model. 

**Hint:** Use the `lm()` function.
