# Load Packages

For this practical, we need the `fda` package and the `refund` ("regression with functional data") package.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(fda) # load the fda package
library(refund) # load the refund package
```


# **Part (a)**: Scalar-on-function Regression

## Short Data Description

For part 1, we'll use the same sample of data as practical 3, which come from the GaitRec dataset (Horsak et al., 2020). 

These functional data represent the vertical ground reaction force measured during walking using force plates for a group of **Healthy controls**. They are defined on the normalised time domain $[0. 100]$ where $0$ represents the start of the stance phase when the foot touches the force plate and $100$ represents the end. The force is normalised to body weight.

We also have a scalar variable, the **maximum anterior-posterior** force produced during the same trial.

## Load Data

You should download for this practical the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/edwardgunning/ISBS-Short-Course/blob/main/practicals/fpca-data.rds) and place it in your working directory. Then we load it and unpack the objects as follows.

```{r}
fpca_data <- readRDS(file = "fpca-data.rds")
grf_fd <- fpca_data$grf_fd # grf functional data object
max_ap <- fpca_data$max_ap # scalar max ap variable
t_grid <- 0:100 # grid of points we'll use to evaluate
```

In the last practical, we applied FPCA to the Vertical GRF curves, and used the FPC scores to predict maximum AP force. 
Let's recap on the code for this.

```{r}
grf_pca.fd <- pca.fd(fdobj = grf_fd, nharm = 6)
grf_fpc_scores <- grf_pca.fd$scores
fpcr_df <- data.frame(grf_fpc_scores, max_ap)
names(fpcr_df)[1:6] <- paste0("fpc_", 1:6)
fpcr_lm <- lm(formula = max_ap ~ fpc_1 + fpc_2 + fpc_3 + fpc_4 + fpc_5 + fpc_6, 
   data = fpcr_df)
summary(fpcr_lm)
```

This is a useful approach, but me way also prefer a model where we have more flexibility in representing how the Vertical GRF curves affect the maximum AP force. Thus, we posit the scalar-on-function linear regression model
$$y_i^{AP} = \beta_0 + \int_0^{100} x_i^{V}(t) \beta_1(t) \mathrm{d}t.$$
Here, $\beta_1(t)$ is a smooth weight function that weights parts of the Vertical GRF curves $x_i^{V}(t)$ to predict the maximum AP force $y_i^{AP}$. Our goal is to estimate the function $\beta_1(t)$.

## Fitting with `pfr()`

Fitting this model with `pfr()` from the refund package is **really** simple. We need to feed in the functional predictor evaluated on a grid (note: manual says that we can supply `fd` object). For now, we just evaluate at $0,1,2\dots,100$:

 * `lf()` specifies a linear functional predictor of the form $\int x(t) \beta(t) \mathrm{d}t$.

 * Use `bs = "bs"` for a "B-spline basis with integrated squared derivative penalties" (see `?mgcv::smooth.terms` for details).

```{r}
grf_fd_eval <- t(eval.fd(evalarg = 0:100, fdobj = grf_fd))
pfr_fit <- pfr(max_ap ~ lf(X = grf_fd_eval, bs = "bs", k = 35, argvals = 0:100))
summary(pfr_fit)
plot(pfr_fit, xlab = "t", ylab = expression(beta(t)))
abline(h =0, lty = 3)
```

Not surprisingly, the function $\widehat{\beta}_1(t)$ is largest (and positive) at about $t=80%$, which is also approximately the time point where the maximum AP force occurs in the stance phase. In other words, producing a larger vertical force at this point is positively associated with producing a larger AP force at this same instant.


## Fitting with `fRegress()`

We can also do this with the `fRegress()` function from the `fda` package. We will not aim to go through it today, but essentially it involves an ordinary cross-validation step to choose the smoothing parameter, as well as a adhering to a slightly strange requirement of setting the scalar parameter $\beta_0$ up as a constant function. We do not provide the code here but it can be found [at this link](https://github.com/FAST-ULxNUIG/SpringerBriefs/blob/main/chapter-06/Case-Study-Part-02-MD.md#fregress).

# **Part (b)**: Function-on-scalar Regression (Functional ANOVA)

Again, our data come from the GaitRec dataset (Horsak et al., 2020). This time we are looking at Anterior-Posterior GRF curves, coming from healthy controls and individuals with impairments in the hip, knee ankle and calcaneous. We formulate a function-on-scalar regression model, to assess the effect of impairment on the Anterior-Posterior GRF (or more specifically, compare average Anterior-Posterior GRF curves between the helathy controls and the different impairment groups).


## Load Data

You should download for this practical the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/edwardgunning/ISBS-Short-Course/blob/main/practicals/fosr-data.rds) and place it in your working directory. Then we load it and unpack the objects as follows.

* `ap_fd` is a functional data object containing our AP force curves, and

* `class_label` is a vector containing the corresponding class labels (e.g., healthy controls, hip impairment etc.)

```{r}
fosr_data <- readRDS(file = "fosr-data.rds")
ap_fd <- fosr_data$ap_fd # ap functional data object
class_label <- fosr_data$class_label # class labels (e.g., "healthy control")
table(class_label)
```

## Function-on-scalar model

We formulate the model
$$
y^{AP}_i(t) = \beta_0 (t) + \sum_{p=1}^5 x_{ip} \beta_p (t) + \epsilon_i (t),
$$
where:

* $y^{AP}_i(t)$ is the anterior-posterior force function for the $i$th individual

* $\beta_0(t)$ is the intercept function,

* $x_{i1}, \dots, x_{i5}$ are dummy-coded scalar covariates that represent membership of the healthy control and ankle, knee, hip and calcaneus impairment groups

* $\beta_1(t), \dots, \beta_5 (t)$ are the corresponding regression coefficient functions for scalar covariates $x_{i1}, \dots, x_{i5}$. We enforce the constraint $\sum_{p=1}^5\beta_p(t)=0$ for all $t$, so that $\beta_p(t)$ represents the deviation of the $p$th group from the overall mean function, and

* $\epsilon_i(t)$ is the smooth functional random error term

## Fitting with `fosr()`

This model can be fit very easily using the `fosr()` function from the `refund` package.

We simply need to set up a design matrix `modmat` containing the dummy variables in its columns and passing it as the `X` argument, and a vector called `constraints` that says which columns of this matrix should sum to zero and passing it as the `con` argument.



```{r}
modmat <- cbind(Intercept = 1, model.matrix(~ factor(class_label) - 1))
(constraints = matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), 1)) # vector says all betas sum to zero
colnames(modmat)[-1] <- stringr::str_remove(colnames(modmat)[-1],
                                            pattern =  "factor\\(class_label\\)")
fosr <- fosr(fdobj = ap_fd,
             X = modmat, # design matrix
             con = constraints, # sum-to-zero constraints
             method = "GLS", # (Reiss et al., 2010)  
             argvals = 0:100)

plot(fosr, titles = colnames(modmat))
```
