# Data

## Short Data Description

We have taken a sample of $30$ functional observations from the GaitRec dataset (Horsak et al., 2020). These functional data represent the anterior-posterior ground reaction force measured during walking using force plates. They are defined on the normalised time domain $[0. 100]$ where $0$ represents the start of the stance phase when the foot touches the force plate and $100$ represents the end. The force is normalised to body weight.

## Load Data

You should download for this practical the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/edwardgunning/ISBS-Short-Course/blob/main/practicals/reg-data.rds) and place it in your working directory. Then we load it and unpack the objects as follows.

```{r}
reg_data <- readRDS(file = "reg-data.rds")
y_fd <- reg_data$y_fd
info_df <- reg_data$info_df
```

The functional data have already been converted to an `fd` object (`y_fd`), so no need to worry about smoothing or data representation. The `info_df` data.frame contains some additional information about the observations (e.g., sex of participant, whether they are impaired or a healthy control).

## Data Exploration

First we will simply plot the functions using the `plot.fd()` function.

```{r explor-plot, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.75}
plot.fd(x = y_fd, xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
title(main = "Anterior-Posterior GRF")
points(x = c(20, 85), y = c(-0.2, 0.2), cex = 15, col = "red") # add circles to highlight
```

We see some misalignement of the first and second peaks (circled in red); these correspond to the maximal propulsive and braking forces in the movement.
In other words, we can say that each individual's maximal propulsive and braking force occurs at a slightly different time point.

# Landmark Registration

In this practical, we will use **landmark registration** to align the curves at the following two points in the movement:

1. The maximal propulsive force (i.e., the negative peak).

2. The maxmimal braking force (i.e., the positive peak).


## Picking out the landmarks

Because our landmarks are simply the overall maximum and minimum of each curve, we can pick them out using a simple grid search.

First, we evaluate each curve on a grid of $101$ time points: $t = 0, 1, \dots, 100$. This results in a $101 \times 30$ matrix with evaluations of the curves in its columns.

```{r def-t-grid}
t_grid <- 0:100
Y_eval <- eval.fd(evalarg = t_grid, fdobj = y_fd)
dim(Y_eval)
```

Next, we use the `apply` function to loop through each column of `Y_eval` and find the the maximum and minimum of each column, as well as the index of the minimum and maximum (this will tell us *when* the maximum occurs).

**Note**: `margin = 2` indicates that we are looping over columns. 

```{r get-landmarks}
y_min_value <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = min)
y_min_index <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = which.min)

y_max_value <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = max)
y_max_index <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = which.max)
```

From the indices, we can directly get the landmark timings (i.e., which times the minimum and maximum occur).

```{r get-landmark-times}
t_min <- t_grid[y_min_index]
t_max <- t_grid[y_max_index]
```

Let's plot out a sample of curves and their landmark timings to verify that we've done this correctly.

```{r plot-landmarks, fig.asp = 0.75, fig.width=6}
inds_obs_plot <- c(1, 11, 21) # indices of three observations to plot
plot(y_fd[inds_obs_plot], xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
points(t_min[inds_obs_plot], y_min_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
points(t_max[inds_obs_plot], y_max_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
```

## Using the `landmarkreg()` function

The `landmarkreg()` function takes the following main arguments (see `?landmarkreg` for full detials):

* `fdobj`: This functional data object contains the curves to be registered. In our case this will be the object `y_fd`.

* `ximarks`: This matrix contains the landmark timings for each curve. It is in the form of an $N \times NL$ matrix where $NL$ represents the number of landmarks. In our case we have $N=30$ curves and $NL=2$ landmarks (the minimum and maximum), so we set up a $30 \times 2$ matrix and put the vectors of landmark timings `t_min` and `t_max` in its columns.

```{r ximarks}
ximarks_mat <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = 30, ncol = 2) # set up empty matrix
ximarks_mat[, 1] <- t_min
ximarks_mat[, 2] <- t_max
```

* `x0marks`: A vector of length NL of times of landmarks for target curve -- here as targets we'll just use the mean average of each landmark timing.

```{r}
x0marks_vec <- c(mean(t_min), mean(t_max))
```

* `Wfdpar` (and `Wfd0par): a functional parameter object defining the (inverse) warping functions. For this we first set up a B-spline basis with interior knots at the mean values of the two landmarks using the `breaks` argument.

```{r}
bspline_basis_wfd <- create.bspline.basis(rangeval = c(0, 100),
                                          breaks = c(0, mean(t_min), mean(t_max), 100),
                                          norder = 4)
```

  Then, because we use a special representation to ensure that the warping functions are non-negative, which relies on an iterative approach to estimate the basis coefficients, we also set up a `fd` (rather than `basisfd`) object. We'll choose all $0$'s as our starting values for the coefficients.

```{r}
WfdLM <- fd(coef = matrix(0, bspline_basis_wfd$nbasis, 1), 
            basisobj =  bspline_basis_wfd) # are these initial guesses
```

  Finally, we will pass this `fd` object to the `fdPar()` function to create a functional parameter object to represent the warping functions, with a second derivative roughness penalty and a (arbitraily chosen) smoothing parameter of $\lambda = 10^{-8}$.
 
```{r}
WfdParLM <- fdPar(fdobj = WfdLM, Lfdobj = int2Lfd(2), lambda = 1e-6)
```

* `x0lim`: A vector of length 2 containing the lower and upper boundary of the interval containing x0marks. Since we are constrng warping functions that map functions to the same domain ($[0, 100]$ to $[0, 100]$) this is just the range of our domain `c(0, 100)`.

* `ylambda`: Because the landmark registration involves a re-smoothing/ interpolation of the curves, we specify a small smoothing penalty (`1e-8`) in this step to avoid artificial bumps or wiggles that sometimes occur.

We then go ahead and perform the landmark registration. We can see that it is applied sequentially for each curve.

```{r landmarkreg}
landmark_reg_obj <- landmarkreg(
  unregfd = y_fd, 
  ximarks = ximarks_mat,
  x0marks = x0marks_vec,
  WfdPar = WfdParLM,
  WfdPar0 = WfdParLM,
  x0lim = c(0, 100),
  ylambda = 1e-8)
```


## Examining the registered curves

`landmarkreg()` returns a named list of length 4 with components:

* `fdreg`: a functional data object for the registered curves.

* `warpfd`: a functional data object for the warping functions.

* `warpinvfd`: a functional data object for the inverse warping functions.

* `Wfd`: a functional data object for the core function defining the strictly monotone warping function.

For this practical, we'll focus on the first two.

```{r}
# extract
reg_fd <- landmark_reg_obj$regfd
warp_fd <- landmark_reg_obj$warpfd
```

Let's look at the registered curves next to their unregistered counterparts. First we'll do so for the full dataset.

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(y_fd)
title("Unregistered curves")

plot(reg_fd)
abline(v = x0marks_vec, col = "grey")
title("Registered curves")
```

And now for the three observations we examined in detail earlier.


```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(y_fd[inds_obs_plot, ])
points(t_min[inds_obs_plot], y_min_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
points(t_max[inds_obs_plot], y_max_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
title("Unregistered curves")

plot(reg_fd[inds_obs_plot,])
abline(v = x0marks_vec, col = "grey")
points(rep(mean(t_min), 3), y_min_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
points(rep(mean(t_max), 3), y_max_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
title("Registered curves")
```

Next, we'll look at the warping functions for the entire sample.

```{r, fig.asp=1, fig.width=4}
plot(warp_fd)
```

And then for the selected observations.

```{r, fig.asp=1, fig.width=4}
plot(warp_fd[inds_obs_plot,])
```

We see that the warping functions encode the order of landmark timings that we saw in the plot of the unregistered functions.

## Analysis of phase variation

All of the information in the warping functions is encoded in our two landmarks, so we can examine their relationship between them and other variables in our data (e.g., sex). Though the sample size of $N=30$ makes it difficult to decipher any clear relationships.

```{r boxplot-sex, fig.asp=0.45, fig.width=8}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(t_min ~ info_df$SEX,
        col = c("red4", "cornflowerblue"),
        xlab = "sex", 
        ylab = "landmark time: min. force")
boxplot(t_max ~ info_df$SEX,
        col = c("red4", "cornflowerblue"),
        xlab = "sex", 
        ylab = "landmark time: max. force")
```

**Note:** When we use more sophisticated continuous registration techniques, we will need to examine the warping functions directly to visualise phase variation as we do here (note that we have to use `lines.fd()` rather than `plot.fd()` as it seems to allow us to specify colours).

```{r, fig.asp=1, fig.width=4}
plot(warp_fd[1,])
lines(warp_fd, col = ifelse(info_df$SEX == 0, "red4", "cornflowerblue"), lty = 1)
```

## A Word of Caution

When using registered functions and warping functions in subsequent analysis it is important to remember that results will be dependent on the registration. That is, subjective choices have been made regarding the type of registration applied (e.g., landmark vs. continuous) and its implementation (e.g., the basis used to represent that warping functions). Ideally, this subjectivity could be acknowledged and checked through a sensitivity analysis.
