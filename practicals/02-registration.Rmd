# Load Packages

For this section, we just need the `fda` package.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(fda) # load the fda package
library(data.table)
```

# Data

## Short Data Description

## Load Data

```{r}
data <- readRDS(file = "data/GRF_dataset_PRO_meta.rds")
data <- as.data.table(data)
table(data$TRIAL_ID)
data <- data[CLASS_LABEL == "HC" & side == "left" & TRIAL_ID == 1 & TRAIN_BALANCED ==1 & component == "anterior_posterior"]
Y <- t(as.matrix(data[, `time_0`:`time_100`]))
t <- 0:100
y_fd <- Data2fd(argvals = t, y = Y)
```

# Data Exploration

First we will simply plot the functions using the `plot.fd()` function.

```{r explor-plot, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.75}
plot.fd(x = y_fd, xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
title(main = "Anterior-Posterior GRF")
points(x = c(20, 85), y = c(-0.2, 0.2), cex = 15, col = "red") # add circles to highlight
```

We see some misalignement of the first and second peaks (circled in red); these correspond to the maximal propulsive and braking forces in the movement.
In other words, we can say that each individual's maximal propulsive and braking force occurs at a slightly different time point.

# Landmark Registration

In this practical, we will use **landmark registration** to align the curves at the following two points in the movement:

1. The maximal propulsive force (i.e., the negative peak).

2. The maxmimal braking force (i.e., the positive peak).


## Picking out the landmarks

Because our landmarks are simply the overall maximum and minimum of each curve, we can pick them out using a simple grid search.

First, we evaluate each curve on a grid of $101$ time points: $t = 0, 1, \dots, 100$. This results in a $101 \times 109$ matrix with evaluations of the curves in its columns.

```{r def-t-grid}
t_grid <- 0:100
Y_eval <- eval.fd(evalarg = t_grid, fdobj = y_fd)
dim(Y_eval)
```

Next, we use the `apply` function to loop through each column of `Y_eval` and find the the maximum and minimum of each column, as well as the index of the minimum and maximum (this will tell us *when* the maximum occurs).

**Note**: `margin = 2` indicates that we are looping over columns. 

```{r get-landmarks}
y_min_value <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = min)
y_min_index <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = which.min)

y_max_value <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = max)
y_max_index <- apply(X = Y_eval, MARGIN = 2, FUN = which.max)
```

From the indices, we can directly get the landmark timings (i.e., which times the minimum and maximum occur).

```{r get-landmark-times}
t_min <- t_grid[y_min_index]
t_max <- t_grid[y_max_index]
```

Let's plot out a sample of curves and their landmark timings to verify that we've done this correctly.

```{r plot-landmarks, fig.asp = 0.75, fig.width=6}
inds_obs_plot <- c(1, 10, 100) # indices of three observations to plot
plot(y_fd[inds_obs_plot], xlab = "t", ylab = "force (bw)")
points(t_min[inds_obs_plot], y_min_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
points(t_max[inds_obs_plot], y_max_value[inds_obs_plot], col = c(1:3), cex = 1.5, pch = 20)
```

## Using the `landmarkreg()` function

The `landmarkreg()` function takes the following main arguments (see `?landmarkreg` for full detials):

* `fdobj`: This functional data object contains the curves to be registered. In our case this will be the object `y_fd`.

* `ximarks`: This matrix contains the landmark timings for each curve. It is in the form of an $N \times NL$ matrix where $NL$ represents the number of landmarks. In our case we have $N=109$ curves and $NL=2$ landmarks (the minimum and maximum), so we set up a $109 \times 2$ matrix and put the vectors of landmark timings `t_min` and `t_max` in its columns.

```{r ximarks}
ximarks_mat <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = 109, ncol = 2) # set up empty matrix
ximarks_mat[, 1] <- t_min
ximarks_mat[, 2] <- t_max
```

* `Wfdpar`: a functional parameter object defining the warping functions

## Examining the registered curves

## Analysis of phase variation

All of the information in the warping functions is encoded in our two landmarks, so we can examine their relationship between them and other variables in our data (e.g., sex).

**Note:** When we use more sophisticated continuous registration techniques, we will need to examine the warping functions directly to visualise phase variation.

```{r boxplot-sex, fig.asp=0.45, fig.width=8}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(t_min ~ data$SEX,
        col = c("red4", "cornflowerblue"),
        xlab = "sex", 
        ylab = "landmark time: min. force")
boxplot(t_max ~ data$SEX,
        col = c("red4", "cornflowerblue"),
        xlab = "sex", 
        ylab = "landmark time: max. force")
```


## A Word of Caution

When using registered functions and warping functions in subsequent analysis it is important to remember that results will be dependent on the registration. That is, subjective choices have been made regarding the type of registration applied (e.g., landmark vs. continuous) and its implementation (e.g., the basis used to represent that warping functions). Ideally, this subjectivity could be acknowledged and checked through a sensitivity analysis.
