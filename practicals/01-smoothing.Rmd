# Structure of the `fda` package

The `fda` package represents functional observations (i.e., *curves*) using a *basis function expansion*. That is, each functional observation $x_i(t), \ i = 1, \dots, N$ is represented as a linear combination (or weighted sum) of known basis functions $\{\phi_k(t)\}_{k=1}^k$ as:

$$x_i (t)=\sum_{k=1}^{K} c_{ik} \phi_k(t).$$

This means that our representation of a functional dataset $x_1(t), \dots, x_N(t)$ should comprise two component parts:

1. The set of known **basis functions** $\{ \phi_K(t) \}_{k=1}^K$. These are *common to all curves*. They are defined in the `fda` package as a `basis.fd()` objects.

2. The basis coefficients $c_{ik}$.
