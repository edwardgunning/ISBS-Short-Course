# The `fd` Class

The `fda` package represents functional observations (i.e., *curves*) using a **basis function expansion**. That is, each functional observation $x_i(t), \ i = 1, \dots, N$ is represented as a linear combination (or weighted sum) of known basis functions $\\{\phi_k(t)\\}_{k=1}^k$ as:

$$x_i (t)=\sum_{k=1}^{K} c_{ik} \phi_k(t).$$

This means that our representation of a functional dataset $x_1(t), \dots, x_N(t)$ should comprise two component parts:

1. The set of known **basis functions** $\\{ \phi_k(t) \\}_{k=1}^K$. These are *common to all curves*. They are defined in the `fda` package as a `basisfd` class.

2. The **basis coefficients** $c_{ik}$. We need $K$ basis coefficients (i.e., 1 coefficient per basis function) to define each individual functional observation. Therefore, for the full dataset of $N$ observations we have an $K \times N$ matrix of basis coefficients.

**Examples:**

```{r create-bspline, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=5}
bspl_20 <- create.bspline.basis(rangeval = c(0, 100), # range of t values
                                nbasis = 20, # number of basis functions
                                norder = 4) # order of the piecewise polynomial (4 = cubic)

# show it is a `basisfd` object
class(bspl_20)
# or 
is.basis(bspl_20)

# plot our basis
plot(bspl_20)
```

<details><summary><b>Construct a Fourier basis with 15 basis functions</b></summary>
```{r create-fourier, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=5}
fourier_15 <- create.fourier.basis(rangeval = c(0, 100), # range of t values
                                nbasis = 15) # number of basis functions

# plot our basis
plot(fourier_15)
```
</details>

In the `fda` package, we combine these two component parts to produce a `fd` ("functional data") object. If we know the basis function system and the matrix of basis coefficients, the code to set up the `fd` object is very simple. We will walk through a short example.

Let's first set up a basis of $20$ cubic B-spline basis functions on $[0,100]$.

```{r, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=4.5}
bspl_20 <- create.bspline.basis(rangeval = c(0, 100), nbasis = 20, norder = 4)
plot(bspl_20)
title("Our B-spline basis")
```

Now, let's imagine we have $N=10$ functional observations. We require a $20\times10$ matrix of basis coefficients. In practice we would calculate or know these. However, for the purposes of this demonstration we will just simulate them randomly on our computer.

```{r}
set.seed(1996) # so random draws are the same
C <- matrix(rnorm(20*10), nrow = 20, ncol = 10) # 20x10 matrix of random values
```

Now that we have our basis object and our matrix of basis coefficients, we can set up our `fd` object using the `fd()` function.

```{r}
toy_fd <- fd(coef = C, basisobj = bspl_20)
```

Let's inspect our first `fd` object.

```{r, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=6}
class(toy_fd) # (or can do is.fd(toy_fd))
plot(toy_fd, xlab = "t", ylab = "x(t)")
title("Our first fd object")
```

**Note**: For more information on building `fd` objects, see Ramsay, Hooker and Graves (2009, pp. 29-31).

# Producing Smooth Functions from Noisy Observations

In most cases we don't know the basis coefficients. Instead, we have to estimate them from noisy sampled measurements of each curve.

For this practical, we'll assume that we measure each functional observation on a common grid $T$ points $t_1, \dots, t_T$, and these measurements are contaminated with some measurement error (or "noise"):
$$y_{ij} = x(t_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij}.$$

---

When creating our `fd` object, we want to recover the underlying functions $x_1(t), \dots, x_N (t)$ as accurately as possible without capturing the noise.

We can do this using a basis expansion, choosing a system of basis functions $\{\phi_k(t)\}$, and then estimating the basis coefficients according to some criteria.

The most straightforward way to do this is by **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**, where for each curve we choose $c_{i1}, \dots, c_{iK}$ to minimise the sum of squared errors (SSE):
$$SSE = \sum_{j=1}^T \left(y_{ij} - \sum_{k=1}^K c_{ik} \phi(t_{ij})\right)^2.$$

To compute the basis coefficients by OLS we can use the `smooth.basis()` function, which takes the following three arguments:

* `argvals`: This is our grid of points $t_1, \dots, t_T$.

* `Y`: This is our $T \times N$ matrix containing the discrete noisy measurements of the $N$ curves at the $T$ sampling points.

* `fdParobj`: For OLS, we just supply the `basisobj` we are using to represent the curves.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ols_fdSmooth <- smooth.basis(argvals = t_grid, y = Y_mat, fdParobj = bspl_35)
```

The `smooth.basis()` function returns an `fdSmooth` object. The most important part of this object is the `fd` element -- this is an `fd` object comprising the basis we have supplied and the coefficients we have estimated, so it represents our dataset of smoothed curves.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ols_fd <- ols_fdSmooth$fd # or ols_fdSmooth[["fd]]
plot(ols_fd[1:3,], xlab = "t", ylab = "x(t)")
matpoints(x = t_grid, y = Y_mat[, 1:3], pch = 20) # overl
```

With the OLS, the smoothness of the fitted curve is controlled by the number of basis functions $K$.

```{r}
# add loop with K
```

A more flexible approach is to choose a risch basis (i.e., a large value of $K$) and add a penalty to the SSE criterion that penalises the roughness of the fitted function
$$PENSSE =  \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^T \left(y_{ij} - \sum_{k=1}^K c_{ik} \phi(t_{ij})\right)^2}_{SSE} + \lambda \text{PEN}(x(t)).$$
This approach is called **Penalised Ordinary Least Squares (P-OLS)**. The roughness penalty we will use is on the integrated squared second derivative of $x(t)$:
$$PEN(x(t)) = \int \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \right)^2 \mathrm{d}t$$
Applying P-OLS with `smooth.basis()` is very similar to OLS, but we pass a general `fdPar` object (rather than just our `basisfd` object) to `fdParobj` argument, to encode information about the basis, the penalty and the smoothing parameter $\lambda$.
We create this object using the `fdPar()` function, passing the following arguments:

* `fdobj`: here we just supply our basis.

* `Lfdobj`: Here we specify the penalty -- `int2Lfd(m = m)` specifies a penalty on the integrated squared $m$th derivative of our fitted curve, so we set $m=2$ for the second derivative penalty.

* `lambda` specifies the value of the smoothing parameter $\lambda$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fdParobj_pols <-fdPar(fdobj = bspl_20, Lfdobj = int2Lfd(m = 2), lambda = 1)
```

We then pass the `fdPar` object that we have created to the `fdParobj` argument in `smooth.basis()` to perform P-OLS smoothing.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pls_fdSmooth <- smooth.basis(argvals = t_grid, y = Y_mat, fdParobj = fdParobj_pols)
```

Let's view the effect on the fit of a single curve when we vary $\lambda$:

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=6}
# create grid of values for lambda varying on a log10 scale
log10_lambda_range <- seq(-10, 10, by = 1)
lambda_range <- 10^log10_lambda_range
n_lambda <- length(lambda_range) # how many values we're trialling

plot(x = t_grid, y = Y[, 1], pch = 20) # plot underlying data (first curve)
for(lam in seq_len(n_lambda)) {
  # loop through different lambdas
  fdParobj_lam <- fdPar(fdobj = bspl_20, 
                        Lfdobj = int2Lfd(m = 2),
                        lambda = lambda_range[lam]) # create fdPar with chosen lambda
  # do p-ols with chosen lambda:
  pls_fdSmooth_lam <- smooth.basis(argvals = t_grid, y = Y_mat, fdParobj = fdParobj_lam)
  # extract fd object:
  pls_fd_lam <- pls_fdSmooth_lam$fd
  # overlay line of current fit
  lines.fd(pls_fd_lam[1, ], col = lam)
}
```

For choosing an optimal value of $\lambda$, we typically minimise some measure of fit to the data that is discounted for the complexity of the model. A common measure is the Generalised Cross Validation (GCV) criterion (Craven and Wahba, 1979). It is returned automatically as part of the `fdSmooth` object returned by `smooth.basis()`. 
In the following, we loop through a range of values for $\lambda$ to find the one that provides the minimum GCV value:

```{r gcv-search, eval = FALSE, fig.asp=0.8, fig.width=6}
# create vcector to store the GCV values:
gcv_vec <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = n_lambda)

for(lam in seq_len(n_lambda)) {
  # loop through different lambdas
  fdParobj_lam <- fdPar(fdobj = bspl_20, 
                        Lfdobj = int2Lfd(m = 2),
                        lambda = lambda_range[lam]) # create fdPar with chosen lambda
  # do p-ols with chosen lambda:
  pls_fdSmooth_lam <- smooth.basis(argvals = t_grid, y = Y_mat, fdParobj = fdParobj_lam)
  # store resulting GCV:
  gcv_vec[lam] <- pls_fdSmooth_lam$gcv
}

plot(log10_lambda_range, 
     y = gcv_vec, 
     type = "b", 
     xlab = expression(log[10](lambda)), 
     ylab = "GCV")
best_lambda_index <- which.min(gcv_vec)
abline(v = log10_lambda_range[best_lambda_index])
```

**Some points to try or discuss in the Q&A:**

* How you would code ordinary cross-validation (leave-one-out and $k$-fold)?

* How would you examine regression assumptions using what is returned by `smooth.basis()`?

* How would you deal with curves measured at different time points?
